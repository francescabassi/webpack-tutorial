# WEBPACK TUTORIAL

This is a step by step tutorial to show how set up a React project using Webpack.

There are 8 + 1 branches, one for each step of the learning process that leads us to create the basis of our Single Page App that uses Webpack and React.

At the end of the 8th step, we get the boilerplate from which to develop the Web App. You can also find the final boilerplate in the `master`branch.

In the last step, however, after having understood all the steps needed during the development stage and how to build properly the project, we introduce a little magic with Facebook tool that can generate the boilerplate without any kind of configuration from our part.

## STEP 1 Getting Started
`1_step` branch: in this first step we set up the project structure and the initial files to start the configuration.

## STEP 2 Configuring Webpack
`2_step` branch: in the second step we introduce the Webpack configuration file.

## STEP 3 Webpack Development Server and Source Maps
`3_step`branch: this step introduces the Webpack Dev Server and the Source Maps option.

## STEP 4 Loaders
`4_step`branch: this step introduces the loaders, in particular the ones used with React.

## STEP 5 CSS
`5_step` branch: in this step we discover the loaders for the stylesheets and the css modules.

## STEP 6 Plugins
`6_step`branch: in this step we discover the plugins, particularly the Hot Module Replacement plugin.

## STEP 7 Linting
`7_step`branch: in this step we talk about linting.

## STEP 8 Building for production
`8_step` branch: in this step we see how to prepare the build release with code minification, bundle splitting, and caching.

## STEP 9 Create React App
`9_step` branch: in this "plus one" step we see how Facebook tool "Create React App" works.
